# Image Based Search Engine for Fashion Products 
Aim : To build an image based search engine that gives product recommendations similar to the fashion products found in an uploaded image.
This uses the YOLOv5 object detection model to accomplish object and specification detection.

## YOLOv5 model has been trained on the following datasets:
1. Colorful fashion dataset from Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nguyngiabol/colorful-fashion-dataset-for-object-detection>
2. Fashionpedia dataset <https://github.com/cvdfoundation/fashionpedia>

The model trained on the Fashionpedia dataset is preferred due to more classes (more specifications/attributes) present

## Web application:
A simple web application has been built using the Streamlit library
